# ClearVoter Web Frontend

ClearVoter is an electronic voting (e-voting) platform that allows individuals or brands create polls in order to get the choice, opinion, or will on a question; from a target audience or a group of persons.

ClearVoter allows users or poll creators restrict the votes to a particular location or region.

ClearVoters also allows users or poll creators decide the requirements for voting e.g valid emails, phone number or IP addresses.

Clear Voter uses a number of APIs to detect if the voter's email, phone number or IP address is valid.
